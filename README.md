# Natours Project (In Development)
This project is part of [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/ "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!") advanced CSS course which I try to recreate on my own after finished the project from the course, all design related element belongs to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/#instructor-1 "Jonas Schmedtmann").

## What did I use in this project?
1. [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide "SASS Guide") which provide many features that make it easier for me to write DRY styling using *variable*, *mixin*, *placeholder*, and *nesting*.
2. [BEM Methodologies](http://getbem.com/introduction/ "BEM Methodologies") as style class naming methodologies that is simple but effective way to separate each style components.
3. [7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern "7-1 Pattern") as a pattern to effectively separate each of my scss files according to their own category.
